            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

No restraint shall ensnare my soul in sin, nor gain that of me, which may make my enemies more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, my friends ashamed, or my Name accursed. They have no great cause to triumph, that they have got my person into their power, since my soul is still my own; nor shall they ever gain my consent against my conscience.

<pb facs="tcp:29477:6"/> to me, as the peace of my Conscience, the Honour of my Crowns, and the welfare of my people. If my Captivity or Death be the price of their Redemption, I grudge not to pay it.</p>
                  <p>Nor are those Divine words ever to be forgotten, which the Denial of his Chaplains attendance drew from <hi>his Most excellent Majesty; viz.</hi> To denie me the Ghostly Comfort of my Chaplains, seems a greater rigour and barbarity, then is ever used by Christians to the meanest prisoners, and greatest Malefactors; whom though the Justice of the Law deprive of worldly Comforts, yet the mercy of Religion, allows them the benefit of their Clergy; as not aiming at once to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy their bodies, and to damn their souls. But my ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny must not be relieved with any one good Angel; for such I account a Learned, Godly, and discreet Divine; and such I would have all mine to be. They that envy my being a King, are loth I should be a Christian; while they seek to deprive me of all things else, they are afraid I should save my soul. I am such a friend to Church-men, that I have hazarded my own Interests, chiefly upon conscience &amp; constancy to maintain their Rights; whom the more I looked upon as Orphans, and under the sacrilegious eyes of many cruell and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Reformers; so I thought it my duty t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Besides, I think a greater blessing and acceptab eness attends those duties, which are rightly performed, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to, and within the limits of that calling, to which God and the Church have specially designed and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

My comfort is, that in the inforced (not neglected) want of ordinary means, God is wont to afford extraordinary supplies of his lifes and graces.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:29477:8"/> will be very pertinent to adde some of his Meditations upon Death, after his closer imprisonment. <hi>viz.</hi> I have now especially, cause to meditate, saith He, and prepare for my death; knowing, there are but few steps between the prisons and graves of Princes. I thank God, my prosperity made me not wholly a Stranger to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of mortality. And, although my death at present may justly be presented to me, with all those terrible aggravations, which the policy of cruell and implacable enemies can but upon it (Affairs being drawn to the very dregs of malice) yet I blesse God, I can look upon those stings as unpoisonous, though sharp since my Redeemer hath either pul'd them out, or given me the Antidote of his death against them: which, as to the immaturity, Injustice, shame, scorn and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of it, exceeded what ever I can fear. Indeed, I never did find so much the life of Religion, the feast of a good conscience, and the brazen wall of a judicious integrity and constancy, as since I came to these closer conflicts, with the thoughts of death.

It is indeed a sad Fate for any man to have his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies his Accusers.

Well, God's will be done. <hi>I</hi> doubt not but my innocencie will find him both my Protector and my Advocate, whom I own as King of Kings; not onely for the eminency of his power and Majesty above them, but also for that singular care and protection, which he hath over them; who knows them to be exposed to as many dangers (being the great Patrons of Law, justice, Order and Religion on Earth) as there be either men or devils which love confusion. Nor will he suffer those men long to prosper in their <hi>Babel;</hi> who built it with the bones, and cement it with the blood of their Kings. I am confident, they will find avengers of my death among themselves: the injuries I have su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained from them, shall be first punished by them, who agreed in nothing so much as in opposing me. I bless God, I pray not so much that this bitter cup of violent death may pass from me, as that of his wrath may passe

For I am not ignorant, there be too many lawless powers, such as of Thieves and Robbers. Let me know by what Law you can challenge this power you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, and then I will answer if you cannot shew your Warrant, take heed what you do; do not bring a guilt of blood upon your selves and the Kingdomes. As for me, I am resolved not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the power God hath committed to the King, confirmed by a long descent</hi> The President objects, and saith▪ He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Tryall by the Right of the people of <hi>England,</hi> by whose Election he was made King: His Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; The Kingdome is not elective, but hereditary, for these Thousand years, and by lawfull succession di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to him: he will maintain the true rights of the people, better then they do. These Rights and power of the people are seen best in Parliaments. A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath in it a King and Lords: None of the Lords are here, neither one nor both Houses, nor any Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal on earth can judge the King of <hi>England;</hi> much less, such men as these; let them shew their authority, and he will answer and make his defence; but 'tis sin to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this unlawfull, as to reject the lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. In speaking this, his Majesty was often interrupted by the President, and at length commanded away to his prison. He is brought again a second and third time; The President requires him to answer to the Charge, or he must hear the sentence of death; The King persists in calling for the authority of the Court his life is not so dear to him as his honour, his conscience, the laws, the liberty of his people: for the preservation of all which he hath great Reasons, why he must not plead before rhese Judges, nor own this new form of judgement. For what power have Subjects to judge their King? or by what Law? Not by Divine: For they command Obedience to Princes. Not by humane or laws of the Land: for the laws of <hi>England</hi> require all tryalls to be made in the Kings Name, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Presistent now, as formerly interrupts his Majesty, rebukes him, and bids him remember the condition he is in. The Court are satisfied in their own authority; neither can they hear any Reason against it. <hi>A strange Court</hi> (saith the King) <hi>that can hear no Reason.</hi> Such you will find this Court to be, quoth the President. The King is instant, that they would receive his Reasons in writing; if they satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, he will yield to their jurisdiction. Here the President is impatient and commands the Guard to take his Majesty away. <hi>Remember, saith he, you will not hear your King; in vain shall my Subjects expect any right from you, when you stop your ears against the Reasons of your King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majestie being the Fourth time brought before the Court, is sharply checked by the President (now in Scarlet) for Contumacie, and the Court extolled for longanimity. Submit your self (saith the President) to the Court, or sentence will be pronounced. The King is the same he was, will not submit, but desires li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to declare some things pertaining to the good of his people, &amp; peace of the Kingdome, in presence of both Houses. This favour being denied, the President, after an Invective against his Majesty, commands the sentence of death to be read; in confirmation whereof All the Iudges present, being in Number 67, (there were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen 150.) Stand up, as it were priding themselves in the boldest Act that ever the Sunne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
                  <p>His sacred Majesty is taken away by the Souldiers, and (as Christ was) mocked. And as at first they had cryed <hi>Justice, Justice,</hi> so now (like Iews) <hi>Execution, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution:</hi> they spit upon his cloaths as he passeth by, one or two upon his face; they blow in his face the smoak of their Tobacco (which they knew he hated) and throw their broken pipes before his feet: they beat any that

                  <p>But the King, with invincible constancy, endureth all things. When the Souldiers cryed out <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> He said, <hi>Poor souls, they would do as much for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mony against their own Commanders.</hi> When he wiped the spittle off his face, He said, <hi>Christ hath suffered more then this for my sake.</hi>

I am now come to the end of my Race, and here I find the Crosse a death of shame, but the shame must be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or there is no coming to the Right hand of God: Jesus despised the shame for me, and God forbid but I should despise the shame for him. I am going apace, as you see, towards the Red-Sea, and my feet are upon the very brinks of it; an argument, I hope, that God is bringing me to the land of Promise; for that was the way by which of old he led his people: But before they came to the Sea, he instituted a Passeover for them; a Lamb it was, but it was to be eaten with very soure Herbs, as in the twelfth of <hi>Exodus.</hi>

                     <p>First, This I shall be bold to speak of the King, our Gracious Soveraign; he hath been much traduced by some for labouring to bring in Poperie; but upon my Conscience (of which I am now going to give God a present account) <hi>I</hi> know him to be as free from this charge I think as any man living, and I hold him to be as sound a Protestant acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ding to the Religion by Law established, as any man in this Kingdom, and that he will venture his life freely for it; and I think I do or should know both his affection to Religion, and his grounds upon which that affection is built, as fully as any man in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second particular is concerning this great and populous City, which God bless: Here hath been of late a fashion taken up to gather hands, and then go to the Honourable and great Court of the Kingdome, the Parliament, and clamour for Justice, as if that great and wise Court (before whom the causes come, which are unknown to the many) could not, or would not do Justice, but at their call and appointment; away which may endanger many an innocent man, and pluck up innocent blood upon their own heads, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps upon this City also, which God forbid: and this hath been lately practised agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st my selfe: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the setters of this, with all my heart <hi>I</hi> beg it; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny well meaning people are caught by it: In Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> case, when nothing else would serve, they stirred up the people against him; <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and <hi>Herod</hi> went just the self same way for when he had killed Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> he would not venture upon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> too, till he saw how the people took it and were pleased with it, in the Twelfth of the <hi>Acts.</hi> But take heed of having your hands full of blood, in the first of <hi>Isaiah:</hi> for there is a time best known to himself, when God among other sins makes inquisition for blood: and when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29477:22"/> inquisition is on foot, the Psalmists tells us, <hi>Ps ame</hi> 9. that God remembers; that is not all, <hi>That God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers and forgets not</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>the complaint of the poor;</hi> and he tells you what poor they are, in the 9. verse, the poor whose blood is shed by such kind of means: Take heed of this; <hi>It is a fearfull thing</hi> (at any time) <hi>to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> in the 12. of the Hebrews: But it is fearfull indeed, and then especially when he is making his inquisition for blood; and therefore, with my Prayers to avert the Prophesie from the City, let me desire that this City would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Prophesie that is expressed, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 29.15.</p>
                     <p>The third particular is this poor Church of <hi>England,</hi> that hath flourished and been a Shelter to other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Churches, when storms have driven upon them; but alas, now it is in a storm it self, and God knows whether or how it shall get out: and which is worse then a storm from without, it is become like an Oak cleft to shivers with Wedges made out of it's own body, and that in every cleft Prophanenesse and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is creeping in apace: while as<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Vit. contemp. cap. <hi>2.</hi>

                        <hi>Prosper</hi> saith, men that introduce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse are cloaked with a name of imaginary Religion: For we have in a manner almost lost the substance, and dwell much, nay too much a great deal in opinion; and that Church▪ which all the Jesuites machinations in these parts of Christendome could not ruine, is now fallen into a great deal of danger by her own.</p>
                     <p>The last particular (for I am not willing to be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I shall hasten to go out of this miserable world) is my self, and I beseech you, as many as be here present within hearing, observe me; I was born and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the bosome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it stands yet established by Law; in that profession I have ever since lived, and in that profession of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion here established I come now to dye; this is no time to dissemble with God, least of all in matter of Religion, and therefore I desire it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29477:23"/> I have always lived in the Protestant Religion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished in <hi>England,</hi> and in that I come now to dye: What clamours and slanders I have endured for labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to keep an Uniformity in the externall service of God, according to the Doctrine and discipline of this Church, all men know, and I have abundantly felt: Now at last I am accused of high Treason in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a crime which my soul ever abhorred: This Treason was charged upon me to consist of two parts, An endeavour to subvert the Law of the Realm, and a like endeavour to overthrow the true Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion established by those Laws. Besides my answers which I gave to the several Charges, I protested my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency in both Houses; it was said that prisoners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations at the Bar must be taken <hi>de ipso;</hi> I can bring no witness of my heart, and the intentions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, therefore must I come to my protestation, not at the Bar, but to my protestation at this hour and instant of my death, in which (as I said before) I hope all men will besuch charitable Christians as not to think I would die and dissemble my Religion, <hi>I</hi> do therefore here with that caution that I delivered before, without all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in the world to my Judges, that are to proceed <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> and so to be understood, I dye in the presence of the Almighty God and all his holy and blessed Angels, and <hi>I</hi> take it now on my death, that I never endeavoured the subversion of the Laws of the Realm, nor ever any change of the Protestant Religion into Popish Superstition; and I desire you all to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this Protest of mine, for my innocency in these and from all manner of Treasons whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>I have been accused likewise as an enemy to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, no, God forbid, I understood them, and the benefits that come by them, a great deal too welto be so, but I indeed dislike some misgovernments (as I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) of some few did one or two Parlaments: and I did conceive humbly that I might have reason for it, for <hi>corruptio optimi est pessima;</hi> There is no corruption in the World so bad as that which is of the best thing in it self, for the better the thing is in nature, the worse it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29477:23"/> is corrupted; and this being the highest and greatest Court, over which no other can have jurisdiction in the Kingdome, if by any way a mis-government (which God forbid) should fall upon it, the Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o be brought up under those Governours to whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e had committed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29477:32"/> him; As being the best he could pick out of all those within his knowledge, and that he should not change them, unlesse they were weary of him; that he should rather want himself, then they should want any thing they could desire,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He chargeth him as he would answer it at the last day, not to put himself upon any publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments till he was thirty years of age at least: And then if his Prince s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, that he should never lay any hand upon any thing that belonged to the Church; He foresaw that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine was like to come upon the Revenues of the Church, and that perhaps they might be shared amongst the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry: But if his Son medled with any of it, he wished the curse of God might follow him and all them, to the destruction <hi>of the most Apostolicall Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth.</hi>

                        <p>There is Sirs terrible aspersions has been laid upon my self, truly such as if my actions and intentions had not been such as they were pretended for: but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I pretended it was for the King, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less intended then to serve him in it.

The first thing which I must professe, is, what concerns my Religion, in the which I have been bred, in the which I have lived, and the which by Gods grace and mercy I shall dye. I have not lived according to that Education I had in that family where I was bred and born. I hope God will forgive me my sins, since I conceive it is very much his pleasure to bring me to this place, for the sins that I have committed. The cause that hath brought me hither, I believe by many hath been much mistaken. They have conceived that I have had ill Designs to the State, and to the Kingdome Truly I look upon it as a judgment and a just judgement of God, not but I have offended so much the State and the Kingdome, and the Parliament, as that I have had no extream vanity in serving them very extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For those Actions that I have done, I think they have gone on couragiously though at last defeated, &amp; in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29477:41"/> posture then they were when <hi>I</hi> was engaged with the Parliament. I have never gone off from those principles that ever I have professed: I have lived in them, and by Gods grace will dye in them. There may be Alterations and Changes that may carry them further than I thought reasonable. And truly there I left them: but there hath been nothing that I have said or done or professed, either by Covenant or Declaration, which hath not been very constant, and very clear, upon the principles that I ever have gon upon; which was to serve the King, the Parliament, Religion, (I should have said in the first place) the Commonwealth, and to seek, the Peace of the Kingdom; That made me think it no improper times, being prest out by Accidens and Circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stances. to seek the Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And God be Praised, although my blood comes to be shed here, there was I think scarce a drop of bloodshed in that action that I was engaged in. For the present Affairs as they are I cannot tell how to judge of them; and truly they are in such a condition, as (I conceive) no body can make a Judgement of them; and therefore I must make use of prayers; rather then of my Opinion; vvhich are, That God would blesse this Kingdome, this Nation this State; that he would settle it in a vvay agreeable to vvhat this Kingdome hath been happilie governed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by a King, by the Lord, by the Commons; a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment that I conceive it hath flourished much under and I pray God the change of it bring nor rather a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, a disorder, and a confusion, than the contrary, I look upon the posterity of the King, and truly my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science directs me to it, to desire that if God be pleased, that these people may look upon them with that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they owe, that they may be called in again, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And truely, Sir, since that the death is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, I am the less troubled with it, because of those violent deaths that I have seen before; principally my Saviour, that hath shewed us the way▪ now and in what manner he hath done it, and for what cause, I am the more comforted, I am the more rejoyced. It is not long since the King my master passed in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and truely I hope that his purposes and intentions were such, as a man may not be ashamed not onely to follow him in the way that was taken with him but likewise not ashamed of his pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I have often disputed with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning many things of this kinde, and I conceive his sufferings, and this better knowledge, and better understanding (if God had spared him life) might have made him a Prince very happy towards himself, and very happy towards this Kingdom. I have seen and known that those blessed souls in heaven have passed thither by the gate of sorrow, and many by the gate of violence; and since it is Gods pleasure to dispose of me this way, I submit my soul to him, with all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and that with all hope that he hath made this my end, and this consolusion, that though I be low in death, yet nevertheless this lowness shall raise me to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est glory for ever.</p>

                        <p>Truly, I have not said much in publick to the people. concerning the peculiar Actions that I conceive I have done by my counsels in this Kingdom, I conceive they are well known, it were something of vanity (me thinks) to take notice of them here: I'le rather die with them, with the comfort of them in my own bosome, and that I never intended in this action, or any action that ever I did in my life, either malice or bloodshed, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to any creature that lives. For that concerns my Religion, I made my profession before of it, how I was bred, and in what manner I was bred, in a Family that was looked upon to be no little notorious in opposition to some liberties they had conceived then to be taken; and truly, there was some mark upon me, as if I had some taint of it, even throughout my whole ways that I have taken: every body knows what my affections have been to many that have suffered, to many that have been in troubles in this Kingdom, <hi>I</hi> endeavoured to relieve them, I endeavoured to oblige them, I thought I was tyed so by my Conscience, I thought it by my charity, and truly, very much by my Breeding; God hath now brought me to the last instant of my time, all that I can say, and all that I can adhere unto is this; That as I am a great sinner, so I have a great Saviour; that as he hath given me here a fortune to come publickly in a shew of shame in the way of this suffering (truely I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it not to be so) I understand it to be a glory, when I co sider who hath gone before me, and a glory when I consider I had no end in it but what I conceive to be the service of God, the King and the kingdom, and therefore my heart is not charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I am going to die, and the Lord receive my Soul; I have no relyance but upon Christ: for my self, I do acknowledge that I am the unworthiest of sinners; my life hath been a vanity and a continued sin, and God may justly bring me to this end, for the sins I have committed against him, and were there nothing e se but the iniquities that I have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29477:43"/> committed in the Way of my Life, I looke upon this as a great Iustice of God, to bring me to this Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and to bring me to this punishment; And those Hands that have been active in it, if any such there hath been; <hi>I</hi> pray God forgive them; I pray God that there may not be many such Trophies of their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but that this may be (as I said b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I was best skill'd in the <hi>Italian</hi> (but free from that vanity, I thank Almighty God) and therefore I would in defence of my life (if it had been the Custom here, or the Judges favour) have used that Language.</p>
                     <p>It was objected. That I did not so freely as a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-paced Cavalier, own my Master. I was told since I came into <hi>England</hi> (for other skill I have not in your Laws) that a legal Denial in Law might be tolerable; I hope I did not exceed the bounds of that in any thing, for God forbid that I should be ashamed of serving so good, so pious, so just a Master <hi>(putting off his hat)</hi> for that I therein rejoyce; and I humbly beseech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to fill my heart and my tongue, and all that hear me this day with thankfulness for it.</p>
                     <p>As to the business, that another construction had been made and believed here, then what was there, the righteous God knoweth its if any weakness was in the management, that was mine: I was sent to serve and protect, not to injure any: and as God acquits me of the intention in matter of Fact, as having done any manner of evil that way, however here understood, blessed be his holy Name, <hi>(putting off his hat)</hi> so those
<pb facs="tcp:29477:60"/> Gentlemen of the Turkey Company, if they would seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider, for they know it very well, the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of my doing them any manner of harm. Whereas that of the Embassie objected against me, that my Master never honoured me withal <hi>I</hi> was never worthy of it, I was his Messenger, an <hi>Internuncio</hi> for the conservation onely of his good Subjects, of all the Merchants, until such time as he could confirm that Gentleman now Resident, or to send any other; and they themselves know that there was impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in me, (as I bless God there was an innocency in me) unto any such intention to do them any harm; for my Master Commands were point-blank the contrary I was onely sent for their good: as I never owned the Title, so the very Letters themselves speaking no other: I never did so much as think of any manner of Address unto the <hi>Grand Seigniour,</hi> but gave him the Letter from my Master; the rest of the English Nation that were there present, may, when they please, assert so much. This I would insert, that those Gentlemen, as they have been losers by the miscarriages of others, may now have no breach of their charity with me; but if it be, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I leave nothing behind me but that I am willing to part withal, all that I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to is desireable: And that you may all know that Almighty God hath totally wrought in me a total Denial of my self, &amp; that there is that perfect Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me within, and of my own corruptions, by the blessed assistance of his holy Spirit, I desire Almighty God in the abundance of the bowels of his mercy in Jesus Christ, not onely to forgive every Enemie, (if any such be in the VVorld, here or wheresoever) but to bring him into his hosome so much good and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular comfort, as he may at any time, whether the Curse were just or unjust, have wished me any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evil, for I take him to be the happy instrument of bringing me to heaven.

                     <p>THe Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> (according to the order of the Court Marshal held at <hi>Chester,</hi> by which he was sentenced to dye at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lancashier</hi>) was brought to that Town with a Guard of Horse and Foot of Col. <hi>Jones</hi>'s commanded by on <hi>Southly,</hi> who received his Order from Col. <hi>Robert Duckenfield,</hi> betwixt 12. and 1. of the Clock on VVednesday the 15 of <hi>October,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple weeping, praying and bewayling him all the way from the prison at <hi>Chester,</hi> to the place of his death.</p>
                     <p>He was brought to a house in the Town near the Crosse, where the Scaffold was raised, and as he passed by, said <hi>(VENIO DOMINE)</hi> I <hi>am prepared to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill thy will, O my God; this Scaffold must be my Cross; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, I take it up willingly and follow thee.)</hi> From thence going into a Chamber with some friends and servants, he was advertised by the Commander in chief that he had till three of the Clock allowed him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death; for indeed the Scaffold was not ready, the people of the Town and Country generally refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to carry so much as a planck, or strike a nail, or to lend any assistance to that work, their cry being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the streets, <hi>O sad day, O wofull day! shall the good
<pb facs="tcp:29477:65"/> Earl of</hi> Derby <hi>dye here?</hi> many sad losses have we had in this VVar, but none like unto this; for now the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Honour of our Country must suffer here: And to add to his trouble, most of the Timber that built the Scaffold, was of the ruins of <hi>Latham</hi>-house; but nothing could alter his Lordships relation and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: for with a stedfast composed countenance, and a cheerful, he called the company which were present to prayers with him, wherein he shewed admirable fervency, and a kind of humble importunity with Almighty God, that he would pardon his sins be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to his Soul; and be gracious to this Land, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing the <hi>King, Law</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> and that he would be a <hi>Husband</hi> to his <hi>Wife,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> to his <hi>Children,</hi> and a <hi>Friend</hi> to all those that suffered by his <hi>Losse,</hi> or that had been Friend to him.</p>
                     <p>Rising from prayer, he sate down with a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing countenance, and assured the standers by, that God had heard his prayes, which the blessed Spirit of God witnessed unto him, in the present Comforts he now felt in his Soul. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n he entred into a discourse of his life, and beseecht God to forgive him the dayes and time he had mis-spent, and said it was his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that although he had not walked so circumspectly as he ought to have done, yet he ever had a sense of his sins, and a tender respect to all the Services, Servants and Ordinances of his God; and that he knew God had mercy for him, that he had strengthened and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him against all the terrours of death.</p>
                     <p>After these and some other words to this purpose, he desired his friends and the people by, to pray with him again; which when he had ended, rising from his knees, he appeard fully satisfied of gracious return to his prayers, and never after shewed any sadness in his countenance.</p>
                     <p>His next business was with his <hi>Son</hi> the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> whom he publickly charged to be <hi>dutiful</hi> to his <hi>sad Mother, affectionate</hi> to his distressed <hi>Brothers</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> and <hi>studi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>Then he desired to be private in the room himself; where he was observed to be about an hour upon his knees with frequent interjections of groans and sighs before his God: Then when he called the company in again, his eyes witnessed to us, that he had abundantly mixed <hi>Tears</hi> with his <hi>Prayers;</hi> he told us that he was very willing to leave the World, being assured by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Gods Spirit, that he should be carried from Trouble, to Rest and Peace, from sorrow to Joy, from Life to Death, and that Death had no other bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness in it to him, but that it took him him from his dear Wife and Children; whom he <hi>humbly</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Protection and Providence of a better <hi>Husband,</hi> and a better <hi>Father;</hi> and that yet he did not doubt, but that the General, and they who sat in the seat of Authority, would make provision for them, hoping that his death might satisfie all those who sought his life, whom he freely forgave, and desired God to do the like. Then calling for his Son, he took his leave of him, and blessed him; which indeed would have grieved any ones heart (though never so harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to see the parting of him now with his Son, and with his two Daughters, the Lady <hi>Katharine,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Amely Stanley,</hi> upon the road betwixt <hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Bolton</hi> the day before.</p>
                     <p>This ended, he called the Officer, and told him he was ready.

                     <p>'Tis a place I desired to see when I was last in the Country, both for the mutual obligations that have been betwixt this Town and my Family, and also for your particular respects to me, whom I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be ready to clear me from that soul imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That I was a man of blaod; and that particularly, I killed one <hi>Bootle</hi> here in cold blood: I doubt not but there are here many men present, both that day this Town was taken and divers other times during this war, that can justifie I preserv'd many lives; but I know there is not any <hi>one present</hi> that can lay the <hi>blood</hi> of any <hi>man</hi> whatsoever to <hi>my charge,</hi> unless that might casually happen in the fury and heat of a Battel; and why I dye in this Town, I know not, unless it be to perswade the Nation that I fall a sacrifice for that blood which some said I shed here, from which I am acquitted before you, and from which I had also cleared my self before my Grand Judges at <hi>VVestminster,</hi> had they pleased to hear me, before they had destroyed me; that report being hastily brought up among them, by some that <hi>I</hi> hope God hath forgiven, and too readily drunk in by others, whom I pray God to forgive.

                     <p>As for my being in arms in the beginning of this war, I profess here in the presence of my God, before whom within a few minutes I must make an account for this profession, I only sought for peace, and fetling the late King my Master in his just rights, and the maintenance of the laws of this Land, and that I had no other design, intent or purpose for my then taking up arms: and for this last ingagement, I profess here again in the presence of the same God, that I did it for the restoring of my lawful Soveraign into that Throne out of which his Father was most unchristianly and barbarously taken by the most unjust sentence of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Court of Justice, and himself against Law
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29477:67"/> and disposest of; and this was all my reason. For a Estate or quality, I wanted not a sufficient compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, neither was I ever ambitious to enlarge either for by the favour of the Kings Predecessors, my family was raised to a condition well known in this Country and now is well known, that by his enemies I am ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to dye, and that by <hi>new and monstrous Laws,</hi> as making me an enemy to my Country; as a Traytor to the Laws, for endeavouring to preserve the Laws: But, <hi>Oh! God give me grace to consider him, who suffered such contradictions of sinners, and O my God, assert the King to his Fathers Throne, assert the Laws to their former honour, and restore thy own Religion in it's purity, that all these sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and false pretences of Religion may vanish away, and our childrens posterities may serve thee in spirit and in truth.</hi>

I leave nothing behind me that I much care for. but my King, my VVife, my Children, my Friends, whom (I trust) the enever failing mercies of my God, will provide for: I brseech God shew mercy to those who neither had mercy or justice for me; my blessed Saviour taught me by his Example and Command, both to pray for my enemies, and to forgive my enemies: I forgive them freely, even those that contrived my ruine, and pursued me to death; I thank God, I never personally of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them to my knowledge in my life, &amp; let me not offend against them at my death; I forgive them freely, and pray God for Christs sake to forgive them truly.</p>

                  <p>during the late unnatural war between his Majesty and the Parliament at <hi>VVestminster,</hi> among many right Noble and loyal Gentlemen, whose obeysance and duty animated them to the peril and danger of the war; taking from it repose of Arts and studies, to which so propictuously nature had inclined them, and in which they had made so eminent a proficiency.

It must not be omitted, both for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Collonel <hi>Andrews</hi> and the better light to the reasons inducing the Council of state then to fasten on him, that he was preferred by the King formerly to be Clark of the Crown in <hi>Ireland,</hi> gnd after was invited by my Lord <hi>Capel</hi> (that glorious loyal Martyr) to be Secretary towards the conclusion of the war, when that Noble man was chief Counsellour to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> his now Majesty whereby he was admitted into a nearness, and communication of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and affairs which related to the King: which great trust as he wisely and gallanty discharged to his glory, to the eximiousness of his place and person al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the jealousie and suspition of the state on him to his ruine.

                  <p>That no suspition might enter into the minde of the Collonel as it might if on a suddain, they had started the design, <hi>Barnards</hi> long before frequent this company venting his discontents against the power, then in being to which the Collonel (as his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment byassed him) lent no unwilling ear.</p>
                  <p>This opening the way to a closer overture, wherein <hi>Barnards</hi> intimated that a general design was on foot for the restoring his Majesty (that now is) and that most of the Nobility were privy and patakers in it, and that indeed it lackt nothing but so able a person as himself to manage the business to a ripeness; to that purpose be then nominated many great persons, among whom as chief was Sir <hi>John Gell</hi> a person that had in the war been very active (against the King. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of that meeting was, that by subscription the design should be carried on, and that when the mony and arms agreed on were ready the entersure should be put in execution, and there withal that Province was laid upon the Collonel (a meeting being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards contrived between him and the second Sir <hi>John</hi>) to get his subscription, which Sir <hi>John</hi> refused to do but said he would at any time be ready to do the King his uttermost service when present, and further would not be dravvn to say,</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:29477:72"/>
                  <p>Then they see they could not by him entrap Sir <hi>John,</hi> he with others came and dispatch of their business, told him; that if he had no more haste the business would be done without him and that he the said <hi>Barnards</hi> would go presently over to the King, and acquaint him what forwardness his affairs were, in if not neglected, which would found little to his honour.</p>
                  <p>The next day after they pressed him again told him, at the three Cranes by the <hi>Savoy,</hi> whereby they met with <hi>Smith</hi> and others that 200 <hi>l.</hi> was ready for a present occasion they had prejected themselves, and that the <hi>Buckingham-shire</hi> and <hi>Kentish</hi> Gentlemen were in a readiness expecting what would he done, whereupon it was advised; there coming then a Proclamation out to Command all Cavaliers to depart <hi>London</hi> and twenty miles beyond, for him to go for <hi>Gravesend</hi> (the Collonel intending there to go into <hi>Norfolk</hi> to some Clients, whose business he had undertaken for setling and conveying of estates if according to promise of the mony, which they had failed in twice, neither it nor the Gentlemen above said should meet him) where a randezvous was appointed. As soon as he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was seized on by a Troop of Horse sent from <hi>London</hi> to the very place he lodged in, and presently brought before a Committee of Examinators where finding he was betrayed from the very first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the design he thought it most generous not to deny it, using then these sentences.</p>

But <hi>Cromwel</hi> having turned out, that Monster of a free-state and put an end to their Tyranny, he as an unfit person and as useless, (being so well known, that all men of any honour avoided him) and that moreover he owned his preferment to his Patrons of a Common-Wealth, was judged unsecure and dangerous to be continued in that quality any longer where upon he was dismissed, and so returned to <hi>London,</hi> where he began his old vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious courses, which soon deceived him of that mony he had got by selling the life of this Collonel and so forced into his old shifts of borrowing as long as his credit or oaths would do it, being rejected and feared by all men, as the common post or band of society, he betook himself to theevery in which (after some other little attempts) he was taken for a Burglery committed on the house of Collonel <hi>VVinshorp</hi> at <hi>VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> Collonel in the same Regiment where he had his Troop in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (where signally may we note how God repayed and retaliated, his villanous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon his first Collonel by a fellonou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>ALthough in this following history we cannot so properly say, there was blood for blood the chief instruments of this horride murder committed on the person of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury;</hi> being pardoned for the extraordinary mercy of the King, yet the Ministers that were imployed for the accomplishment of it, were brought all unto condign punishment as by the <hi>Sequele</hi> of this history shall appear.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> discended of an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>Glocester-shire,</hi> added to the splendor of his <hi>Natals</hi> by the Excellence of his <hi>Naturals.</hi> In his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority he had an extraordinary happiness to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and as great a faculty to retain what he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, which commended him very early from the free-School in <hi>Glocester-shire</hi> to the University of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and from thence to the Innes of Court. VVhere having in a short time given many pregnant proofs of his extraordinary abilities; his parents thought fit that he should accomplish what he had gained in his studies at home, by the advantage of new observations in travailes abroad. On his return to <hi>England</hi> he was generally looked upon, as one of the most qualified persons in the Nation. His book, called his characters,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29477:76"/> was a great testimony of his wit, and the probity of his life in so young an age was as great a proof of hs wisdom. This rendred him remarkeable to many eminent personages of the Court and especially to Sir <hi>Robert Car</hi> created lately Viscount <hi>Rochester</hi> who being in greatest favour with the King▪ was indeed the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of it, in the mean time the King multiplied favours upon favours, and places of the greatest dignity on Sir <hi>Robert Car</hi> for besides his being Viscount of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> he made him Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> one of the Privy Councel, and principal Secretary of state: For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mannaging of which, great imployments he anicted himself with the rate indowments of Mr. <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But let him be never so naught, or so corrupt, the most barbarous and bloody murder of him cannot be excused; it was brought to the Countesse of <hi>Essexs</hi> ear that Sir Thomas <hi>Overbury</hi> should say that she was a Whore, and that oftentimes he had inveighed very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly against her to the Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and perswaded him to abstain from her company, and that words had passed in a very high nature betwixt the Earl of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> who threatned swell as advice the Earl, when he bid him be sure that he stood fast if he kept the Countess of <hi>Essex</hi> company any longer neither was the answer to be forgotten which the Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> immediately returned in these words,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My own legs are straight and strong enough to bear me up, but in faith I will be even with you for this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These words of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> did move the Earl unto a suddain choller, but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse who before did bear a great hatred to him, was now at the hearing of this, so trapsported with fury and revenge, that immediately with tears in her eyes, she repaired to Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> to renew her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, protesting that she was never so defamed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did she ever think that any man durst have been so sawsy as to call her whore or base woman, especially to her Lord, the Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and with so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and undaunted a face as <hi>Overbury,</hi> that Negro, that scum of men, that devill incarnate, who dares speak any thing and yet pass unregard anded unpunisht. This moves pity in Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> who weeps as fast to see her weep; at the last they both resolve on to be the death of him, Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> tells the Countesse, that it is pity that he should live to defame so honourable a Lady and so well descended, to the utter disparaging of her House, and that rather he should passe with life, she would be his deaths-man her felf. But cast about which way to do it, they conclude the safest way was by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son but when they were to seek for the party that should perform it; for it must be some Apothecary or physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian that had the Art to temper the poyson rightly to take effect accordingly.

                  <p>the letter being read, the Earl writes back unto him, that the Court was at present busie about importent affairs but as soon as he could finde opportunity, he would not fail to speak in his behalf. In the mean time to ease the pain of his melody he had sent him a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign powder either to be eat or drink which powder was rank poyson.</p>
                  <p>We made mention before of the death of Doctor <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whom <hi>Gresham</hi> succeeded, and who dyed also in a short time after him, and one <hi>Franklin</hi> was entertained in his place who was thought to be no less a wizzard then the two former, and was admirable in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and laying of poyson, he confessed at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment that on the request of Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> who came from the Countess to him he bought seven sorts of strong and rank poysons, <hi>viz.

                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> being thus extreamly afflicted both in mind and body knew not what to conclude of himself, the Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> under pretence of love sent oftentimes to visite him and sometimes Mr. <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>OF all the impotencies of malice and revenge, there is not in History any such relation, as this touching the death of this famous and most noble person.

If we consider him, we shall find him to be the most approvedst, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lientest Loyal subject the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation ever bred; if we consider his enemies we shall find many of them to have been Nobles, learned and able men; if we consider the times he lived in, they were full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and danger, if the state, in as great turbulency as those times and its own prevalent corruption could make it, so that <hi>Scotland</hi> had never more need of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant resolute and knowing men to steere and assist her in those tumultuary Seas which the Volge swelled by the rage of a mad Clergy had raised in that Kingdom; if we again consider his enemies in the same times and state of affairs we shall find them doing all they could, their very uttermost, to embroyle and confound their own Countre, yand at last reduced it by their devisions and separations of their fellow subjects, under the yoak of the <hi>English</hi> Common-Wealth, whom before they had so powerfully assisted in their rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst both of their lawful Soveraigns; a crime in them so muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>He was born and descended of one of the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienst noble families in <hi>Scotland,</hi> one of his great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors having been the Champion and restorer of his Country, and much celebrated for many illustrious actions in the <hi>Scotch Chronicles,</hi> having been Regent or some such supream Officer in that Kingdom during the disputes for that Crown betwixt <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Bayliol,</hi> From that time his family continued in great luster, with the title of <hi>Montross,</hi> which in this person was advanced to a Marquisate by his worthy atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ancient splendor of his house being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equalled but gloriously surpassed. To his other dignities this being added. <hi>The Kings governour General of his Kingdom of Scotland,</hi> Tantamount to the same eminency of that his famous progenitor.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the <hi>Scotch</hi> troubles he was thought to be be very forward, with the rest of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the business of the pretended reformation, and upon the raising of arms there by the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was made a Brigadeer with a Command over 2500 Horse and Foot, which he passed first of all the <hi>Scotch</hi> army over <hi>Tweed</hi> in the year 1639. and that the better to amuse the Grandees of the Rebellion, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand maintaining intelligence with the King, and giving him an account of their proceedings.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Newcastle</hi> taken by them in the year 1640 some jealousie was had of him by the Covenanters, being led thereunto by some papers discovered which had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dropt or been taken put of the Kings pockets by Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> or some of his confidents (that family being enemies and at feud with the Marquess) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he and Lord <hi>Napter,</hi> were pesently secured and imprisoned, but upon the pacification soon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded set again at liberty

                  <p>Much about the same time his brother being returned from <hi>Sussex,</hi> and having some business that called him to <hi>London</hi> by an obvious mistake (rising early in the morning) did put on his brother <hi>Freemans</hi> doubler, and being come home de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired his brother that he might have his own again, which he obstinately denyed, although his Father did use his auhority therein, and did command him to give it him, whereupon his Father said unto him. I <hi>see son Freeman this is nothing but wilfulness to cross your brother, to whom you have no reason to be so dogged, for I tell you, I dye, you must be beholding to him, and whatsoever your flatterers tell you of a thousand pound a year or more that you have, which your Father cannot keep from you, I who know better then they, tell you plainly, that you have not a groat but what you must be beholding to your Father for, and that it is in his power to leave you as little as your Uncle</hi> Nicholas <hi>had loft him. And therefore you need not carry your self so stubbornly against him, as if all were your own already; I tell you these cross humous of yours, if you continue in them, will ruine you.</hi>

                  <p>Three months were now elapsed since this contestation happened, and yong <hi>Freeman,</hi> the better to conceale his bloody resolution, did ever afterwards enteriain his Father and his brother with all the duty, and respect could be imagined, in so much that all former quarrels seemed to be buried and quite forgotten.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Worth,</hi> a citizen of London, being gone to Bristoll Fair upon the affairs of his own trade, took one of his apprentises along with him, and left behind him another apprentice, <hi>Iohn Knight</hi> by name, to manage his affairs at home in his absence, This young man being acquainted with <hi>Butler</hi> desired him to be his bedfellow untill his master and fellow apprentice should return from Bristol.

                        <p>Then kneeling down he said the Lords prayer.</p>
                        <p>Then having praied a short space, he stood up, and turning to the Executioner, said,</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>Then the Executioner going to spread the Scarff over the block, he said,</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Sir <hi>H. Hide.</hi>

                        <p>God reward you all.</p>
                        <p>Then the Executioner going to put up his hair under his Sattin cap, he thought he had been taking of it off; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he said,</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Sir <hi>H. Hide.</hi>

                        <p>Must I have my black Cap off? it is very cold; all these diseases will be cured, the Lord be thanked.</p>
                        <p>Then going to lie down, his man not helping him, he said,</p>

                        <p>Then rising again upon his knees, he spake to the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, having the Ax in his hand.</p>

                        <p>Pray Sir give me the Ax:</p>
                        <p>And then taking the Ax in his hand, he kissed it, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the Executioner again, saying,</p>

                     </sp>
                     <p>And then lying down again, after a little space he lift up his right hand, and the Executioner at one stroak severed his head from his body.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> am become a publick spectacle to Men and Angels, and (<hi>I</hi> hope) God, who is Omniscient, is now beholding me with much pity, and great mercy and compassion; and the more, because <hi>I</hi> am now come to that end that his own Son came into the world to, To bear witnesse to the truth: he himself said, <hi>For this end was I born, for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth: I</hi> was brought into the world (the Christian world) for to bear witness to the truth of the Gospel, as a common Christian; I was brought into the world (the Church) as a Minister of his blessed Word and Sacraments; [Blessed be his Name for that honour and dignity;] and <hi>I</hi> came into the world to die more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for the testimony of JESUS, which God hath now called me to. I came into this world (this Common-wealth) to be a Member thereof, to bear witnesse to the truth of the Customes; the Lawes, the Liberties, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges thereof, So J am a Member of the Common-wealth: And methinks it seems to me a strange thing, that in as much as we all plead for Liberty, and Priviledges, and <hi>I</hi> pleading for the Priviledges, the Lawes, the Statutes, and the Customs of this Land, yet I should die by those that should stand for the Lawes, the Statutes, and Priviledges of the Land: And I am here beheld of those that plead for their Liberties, and I hope I am pittied because I here give up my self willingly and freely to be a State Martyr for the publick good; and <hi>I</hi> had rather die many deaths my self, than betray my fellow-free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to so many inconveniences that they might be like to suffer by being subject to the wills of them that willed me to this death.</p>
                     <p>And it is worthy remembrance, that Mr. <hi>Sollicitour</hi> having impeached me of Treason to the Commissioners of the Court against his Highness, I did often (when brought before the Commissioners) plead for the Liberties of the people of <hi>Engl.</hi> though I had no knowledge of the Law, yet I had instruction from those that were learned in the Law, &amp; had several Law-Cases &amp; Presidents put into my hand, though not by them &amp; urged several Law-Cases, &amp; made my appeal, First for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29477:99"/> that I was to be tried by, whether it were according to Law? whether it were according to the Act? and whether it were according to the words of the said Act? <hi>I</hi> did appeal to have the said Act argued by learned Lawyers on both sides, &amp; then to be resolved by his Highness own Council, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> was denied me, [This by the by] <hi>I</hi> pressing the Argument made a secōd Appeal that those Judges if they would singly give their several Judgements that it was a just &amp; lawful Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, J would answer to my charge; J did make another Appeal to those that were his Higness's Council, and pleaded against me. That if they would deliver it to me under their hands to be according to Law, <hi>I</hi> would then go on to plead &amp; answer to the Charge. What was then said further, my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being faint, I shall not say much, but only this, I was taken in three defaults upon formality of the Court: It seems it is a custom in all Courts, (w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> I did not know before) that if they answer not the third time speaking by the Clerk, that then they are guilty of three defaults, and proceeded against as mute: [J had no such knowledge of the Law.] So they found me guilty of those defaults; and when <hi>I</hi> would have pleaded, &amp; resolved to begin to plead, <hi>I</hi> was taken from the Bar.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29477:100"/> grounds adjudg'd me to die, taking advantage of such sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ignorance as <hi>I</hi> was in. And <hi>I</hi> had at the very beginning of my pleading engaged their Honours, no advantage should be taken against me to my prejudice, that in as much as <hi>I</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood nothing of the Law, and having heard that a man in the nicety of the Law might be lost in the severity thereof, meerly for speaking a word out of simple ignorance, I made it my prayer to them, that no advantage might be taken against me to the prejudice of my person: and there was to me a seeming consent; for the President told mē, there should be no advantage taken against me: and upon these considerations <hi>I</hi> am afraid there was too great uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But <hi>I</hi> pray God forgive them from the very bottom of my soul, and <hi>I</hi> desire that even those that shed my blood, may have the bowels of the God of Mercy shed for them.</p>
                     <p>And now having given you the occasion of my coming hither, it is fit <hi>I</hi> should give you somewhat as concerning my self, as <hi>I</hi> am a Christian, and as <hi>I</hi> am a Clergy-man. First as <hi>I</hi> am a Christian, <hi>I</hi> thank God <hi>I</hi> was baptized to the Holy Church, so <hi>I</hi> was baptized to be a Member of the Holy Catholick Church, that is the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> dare say for purity of Doctrine, and orderly Discipline, till a sad Reformation had spoiled the face of the Church, and made it a query, whether it were a Church or no? J say, it was more purely Divine and Apostolical, then any other Doctrine or Church in the Christian world, whether Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, or Classical, or Congregational: And J must tell you, That as J am a Member of this Church, so J am a Member of the Holy Catholick Church, and shall give a most just Confession of my Faith, both negatively and affirmatively. Negatively, J am so a Member of the Holy Catholick Church, that J abhor all Sects, Schisms, Sedition, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in Religion. Affirmatively so, that as J hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, so J love and honour all Christians in the world, that love the same Lord JESUS in sincerity, and call on his Name, agreeing with those truths that are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary and clearly demonstrated in the Word of God; both in the Old and New Testament, though in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dissenting from some others that are not necessary. And J, as J am thus a Christian, J hope for salvation through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:29477:100"/> of Christ Jesus, his blood I relie on, his merits J trust to for salvation of my own Soul: though to this Faith Good Works are necessary; not meritorious in us, but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ely made meritorious by Christ his death, by his all-sufficiency, by his satisfaction, and his righteousness, they become meritorious, but in us they are no other than as defiled rags. And truly, as J am a Member of the Church, so J told you, J was a Member of this Community, and so pleaded for the Liberties and Priviledges thereof. J must now answer something J am as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed withall in the world.</p>
                     <p>They talk of something of a Plot, and a Treasonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and that J had a great interest in the knowledge and practice thereof, and that, for the saving my life, J would have discovered and betraied J cannot tell what. J hope my conversation hath not been such here in this City, where J have been a long time very well known, as to make one imagine J should intermeddle in such an Action, and go so contrary to the practice of my profession: and J hope there are none so uncharitable towards me, as to believe J had a knowledge of that design.</p>
                     <p>Here I must come to particulars for a Plot, of having a design upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the firing of it; I so much tremble at the thought of the thing that should have been done, as they say, for the carrying on of such a design, (if my heart deceive me not) had I known it, I so much abhor the thing, J should have been the first discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it: Nor ever had J correspondency o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> meetings with such persons as would have carried on such a design Jt is said likewise <hi>I</hi> entertained the Earl, the Marquess of <hi>Ormond;</hi> To my rembrance I never saw the face of that Honourable person in my life. Jt is said one Lords day <hi>I</hi> did preach at Saint <hi>Gregories,</hi> and the next Lords day I was at <hi>Brussels</hi> or <hi>Bruges,</hi> and kist the Kings hand, and brought J cannot tell what Orders and Instructions from him. This I shall say For these three years last past together, I have not been sixty miles from this City of <hi>London,</hi> and I think it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further to either of those places than threescore miles. It is said that I kept correspondency with one <hi>Mallory</hi> and <hi>Bishop:</hi> They are persons I have heard of their names, but never saw their faces; and to my knowledge I do not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:29477:101"/> know they know me, nor do I know them at all, but onely as J have heard of their name. And whosoever else hath suggested such things against me, I know not.</p>
                     <p>His Highness was pleased to tell me, <hi>I</hi> was like a flaming Torch in the midst of a sheaf of Corn: He meaning, <hi>I</hi> being a publick Preacher, was able to set the City on fire by sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and combustions, and promoting designes. Here truly I do say, and have it from many of those who are Judges of the High Court, that upon examination of the business they have not found me a medler at all in these affairs. And truly I must needs say therefore, That it was a very unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table act in them (whoever they were) that brought such accusation against me, and irritated his Highness against me. I will not say it was malice, it might be zeal, but it was rash zeal which caused me to be sentenced to this place: The God of mercy pardon and forgive them all. And truly as J am a Member of the Church, and as a Member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity where on my behalf I have been speaking, I cannot but do as our Saviour himself did for his Disciples when he was to be taken from them, he blessed them, and ascended up to Heaven. My trust is, in the mercy of the most High J shall not miscarry; and however my dayes are shortned by this unexpected doom, and shall be brought untimely to the grave: J cannot go without my prayers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THis useful Manual which hath been so long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, now offers it self to your hands, the English Iliads in a nut-shel, being comprized in such an Epitomy and Abridgement; yet with so much perspicuity, faithfulness and truth, as would be allowance enough for a reasonable volumn.</p>
                  <p>Even some small and minute actions, where (like little wires that give motion to the grand Engine) they lead to the main design, are here registred, with a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Chronology of their time; but as to passages of greater moment, the actions of the Field, Leagures, Stratagems, storming of Towns and Castles, they have roomy place here, without that bustle they made in the Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>And that the memory of those Noble and Valiant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who fell, and who survived this fatal War, might be orderly transmitted to posterity, we have also inserted them in their several stations of Command, Life and Death, the irreparable loss of whom fell chiefly on the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and justest side.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29477:103"/>
                  <p>Abundance of English blood hath been shed profusely in several Quarrels, both at home and abroad before, but never such a slaughter as this, so that it passeth easie Arithmetick, which causeth that the gross of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers slain, is as much (of the multitude) as could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p>But behold the greatest misery of this War, the issue of it when it was past, was ten times worse then the War it self, like the Viper, that expires in the production of many: The Medusa of War, brought forth a Hydra of Peace, in a Serpentine Commonwealth, and Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Anarchy, we had lost what was pretended to be fought for, as soon as we had done fighting: such our fury, such our strange fate.</p>
                  <p>This obliged the Collector of this Chronicle to proceed in the tracing of those (till then) untrodden steps of Government, through all the changes and variations during the Ʋsurpation; wherein you shall finde all the most considerable passages and remarks of State, of the War and Treaties abroad with Forreign Princes and Commonwealths, particularly set down, so conform to the Originals, that herein you will have the pleasure to see all over again, which with sorrow you so lately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, with the happy restitution of His Majestie, and other passages deduced to this present day.</p>

                  <head>A Brief CHRONICLE OF THE Civil Wars OF <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> From 1640. to the end of the Year, 1661.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O higher or greater cause can be assigned for this war (setting aside the sins of all Times and Nations, to which the Justice of Heaven is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom long a Debtor) but the fate and cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe of Kingdoms and Monarchies, which do at certain periods of time taste of that vicissitude and mutability, to which other sublunary things are more frequently subjected.</p>
                  <p>The secondary causes of it, are so many and so uncertain,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29477:104"/> so variously reported and beleeved, that it would spend the paper allotted to this Epitome in ascertaining them; therefore to contain and keep within the limits of this designment, something onely shall be said of them that was obvious to every eye, not savouring of partiality or affection.</p>
                  <p>Many disorders and irregularieies there were in the State no doubt, contracted through a long and lazy peace, bolstred up with an universal trade which procured a general wealth, the parent of wantonness; the excess of National riches being but as the burden which the Ass carries, and mistakes for provender; people being onely the better enabled to sustain the future misery with their present plenty.</p>
                  <p>These conceived abuses in the menage of the State, like ill Humors, where they finde an equal resistance, or over power of Nature, sunck and descended upon the Ecclesiastical regiment too impotent to sustain those general assaults which were given it. The first complaint of the people was male-administration and delinquency of some about the King; this terrified but a few, though it reached the life of that incomparable Statesman the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> some others dreading more the popular fury then their objected crimes, withdrawing and absenting themselves from the present storm impending.</p>
                  <p>After the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was beheaded at Tower hill (the King being forced to assent to the Bill for his execution) all things run a main without any stop to the ensuing breach and confusion. The Axe had but tasted of that blood, of which it soon after glutted it self, all persons of all ranks and conditions, King, Lords, Bishops, Knights, Gentlemen, Ministers, Mechanicks, suffering under its edge. A remarkable thing, the parallel of it being no where in our English Chronicles, but so that blood of <hi>Straffords</hi> was at last expiated, as will be seen in the series of our late unhappy, troubles.</p>
                  <p>When this fatal business was over, then began the cry, <hi>No Bishops, no Bishops,</hi> who were at last by an Act of Parliament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from the King devoyded and barred from sitting and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the House of Lords, or exercising any temporal Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; to this the Parliament were the better induced, and the more strongly inclined from several complaints made to them, which were before famous through the Nation, of their hard and barbarous usage of several Ministers and others, for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of non-conformancy: Amongst the rest the cases of Mr.

                  <p>This was attempted by the King, but the birds were flown, notice being given the House of Common by one <hi>Langrish,</hi> a Servant or the Queens, of the Kings coming thither to demand the Five Members: But the business ended not so, the House vote it a breach of priviledge, and complain o evil Counsellors about the Kings person, who not able or willing longer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure those indignities offered daily at h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I shall be very little heard of any body else, I shall therefore speak a word to you here: Indeed I could have held my peace very well, if I did not think, that holding my peace, would make som men think, that I did submit to the Guilt, as well as to the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But I think it is my duty to God first, and then to my Country, to clear my self, both as an honest man, a good King, and a good Christian.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> Shall begin first, with my <hi>Innocency;</hi> and, in troath, I think it not very needful for me to insist long upon this: For all the world knows, that I did never begin a <hi>War</hi> with the <hi>two Houses of Parliament;</hi> and I <hi>call God to witness,</hi> unto whom I must shortly make an account, that I did never intend to incroach upon their <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges:</hi> They began upon me; it is the <hi>Militia</hi> they began upon: They confess the <hi>Militia</hi> was mine, but they thought it fit to have it from me. And to be short, if any body will look to the dates of Commissions, of their Commissions and mine, and likewise to the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will see clearly, that they began these unhappy <hi>Troubles,</hi> not I. So as for the guilt of these enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crimes that are laid against me, I hope that God will clear me out▪ I will not (for I am in charity) and God forbid that I should, lay it upon the <hi>two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament,</hi> there is no necessity of either, I hope

But this is not all, my charity must go further, I wish that they may repent, for indeed they have committed a great sin in that particular; I pray God with <hi>S Stephen, that this be not laid to their charge:</hi> And withall, that they may take the right way to the peace of the Kingdome; for my charity commands me, not only to forgive particular men, but to endeavour to the last gasp, the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So (Sirs) I do wish, with all my soul: (I see there are some here that will carry it further:) that they endeavour the peace of the Kingdome. (Sirs) I must shew you, both how you are out of the way, and put you in a way. First, you are out of the way, for certainly all the wayes you ever had yet, as far as I could find by any thing, is in the way of Conquests: Certainly this is an ill way, for Conquest, in my Opinion, is never just, except there he a just and good cause, either for matter of wrong, or a just title; and then if ye go beyond the first quarrel
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29477:120"/> that ye have: that makes it unjust at the end, that was just at first: for if there be only matter of Conquest, then it is a great robbery; as a Pyrate said to <hi>Alexander, That he was the great Robber himself, himself was but a petty Robber.</hi> And so, Sirs, I do think, for the way that you are in, you are much out of the way: Now, Sirs, to put you in the way, believe it you will never go right, nor God will never prosper you, until you give God his due, the King his due (that is, my Successor) and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their due; I am as much for them as any of you. You must give God his due, by regulating rightly his Church, according to the Scripture, (which is now out of order.) and to set you in a way particularly, now I cannot; but only this, A National Synod freely called, freely deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among themselves, must settle this: When every Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is freely and clearly heard. For the King, indeed I will not, the Laws of the Land will clearly instruct you for that; therefore because it concerns mine own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I only give you a touch of it. For the People, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I desire their liberty and freedome as much as any body whomsoever: But I must tell you, that their liberty and their freedeme consist in having Government under those Laws, by which their lives and theirs may be most their own; it is not in having a share in the Government, that is nothing pertaining to them: A Subject and a Soveraign are clean different things; and therefore until you do that, I mean, that you put the people into that liberty, as I say, certainly they will never enjoy themselves.</p>
                     <p>Sirs, it was for this that now I am hither come, for if I would have given way to an arbitrary way, for to have all Laws changed according to the power of the Sword, I need not have come here; and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your charge) that I am the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29477:121"/> Martyr of the people. Introath Sirs, I shall not hold you any longer, I will only say this to you, that I could have desired some little time longer, because I would have put this, what I have said, in a little better order, and have had it a little better digested then I have done; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope you will excuse me; I have delivered my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, I pray God you take those courses, that are best for the good of the Kingdome, and your own Salvation.</p>

                     <p>Between six and seven a clock, in the dusk of the evening, the King, accompanied with the chief of his Nobility, and some sixty horse, departed Northward out of S. <hi>Martins</hi> gate: Having rid a little way, and upon consultation held what to do

This the King was informed of by his two aforesaid Scouts, who strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for intelligence neer the village.</p>
                     <p>This Thursday the King continued all day in the wood, upon the ground, <hi>Richard Pendrill</hi> being constantly with him, and sometimes the other three: It proved to be a very rainy day, and the King was wet with the showers; thereupon <hi>Francis Yates</hi> his wife came into the wood, on whom the King at first

After he had drank some, and eat some in a Pewter spoon; he gave the rest to <hi>George,</hi> and bid him eat it, for it was very good. There was nothing of moment passed this day in Court, but only his Majesty exchanged his Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill for <hi>Francis Yates</hi> his Broom-hook, being something lighter.</p>
                     <p>The King was hardly brought to fashion himself to their gate, or to bend his streight body down to his feet, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in his stay and passing to <hi>Worcester,</hi> he could tune pretty well; most of the day was spent in conforming him to their words, till about five a clock that evening, the King with his gallant Retinue of <hi>Richard, Humphry, George,</hi> and <hi>Francis Yates,</hi> left the wood, and betook himself to <hi>Richards</hi> little house, where he went under the name of <hi>William Iones,</hi> a Woodcutter, newly come thither for work. At his coming, the good wife for his entertainment at supper, was preparing a Fricass of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con and Eggs, and while that was doing, the King held on his knees their Daughter <hi>Nan:</hi> He eat very little, ruminating and pausing on his intended passage into <hi>Wales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After supper ended, the Mother of the <hi>Pendrills</hi> came and kneeled, and took her leave of the King; so did the rest of his poor mean attendants, only <hi>Richard</hi> went along with the King, to conduct and guide him, it being then dark, and the way troublesome.</p>
                     <p>Their intended journey was to Mr. <hi>Wolfes</hi> of <hi>Madely,</hi> some 5 miles distant from <hi>White-Ladies,</hi> of whom the King had a good character from his servant <hi>Richard.</hi> By the way they were put to a fright at a Mill-water, by a Miller that had taken into his protection some of the same undone party, so that <hi>Richard</hi> was forced to wade through, and the King to follow him by the ratling musick of his leather breeches.</p>
                     <p>It was late at night before they got to <hi>Madely;</hi> wherefore <hi>Richard</hi> very confidently knockt at Mr. <hi>Wolfes</hi> door, which his Daughter opening, he desired to be let in, telling her the King was with him: So they both entred, till Mr. <hi>Wolfe</hi> came and welcomed the King, who though wearied, and his feet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely

Here he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (which was his main business) that there was no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to be had over <hi>Severn</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> the river being so guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and watched, that there was no attempting of it without extreme hazard and peril. After some other discourses of the like tendency, the King was conveyed to an Heyloft, where he and <hi>Richard</hi> reposed themselves (though the Kings sore feet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much troubled him) that night, and next day, being Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and on that night, the same hour they arrived, they set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Boscabell,</hi> having had provision, and some money from the said Mr. <hi>Wolfe,</hi> his Daughter also bringing the King into his way some two miles, and then she returned.</p>
                     <p>At his coming to <hi>Boscabell,</hi> the King was so wearied, his feer being blistered with travelling in such course and stiff accourre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he had on his legs, and lying in them, that he was scarce able to stand or go, which <hi>Will.</hi> wife perceiving, she stript off his stockings, and cut the blisters, and washed his feet, which gave the King some ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The news of this afterwards something amused the King, but the Colonel told the King there was no danger in it, for upon his life they should prove constant and faithful to his Majesty.</p>
                     <p>At night, the King and the Colonel came down from the Tree, by the same Ladder they gat up, and was brought into <hi>Boscabell</hi> garden, where he sate in the Bower of it, and drank part of the wine which <hi>Richard</hi> brought from <hi>Woller Hampton,</hi>

                     <p>About this time a massacre was committed in <hi>Piedmont</hi> on the Protestants there (many say not for Religion, but Rebellion) and vast sums of money were raised by a Declaration of the Protectors, resenting their miserable estate, most part of which came into his own purse at the Conclusion; yet while he was taking money in one hand for the Christians accompt, he had another open for the Jewish, who about this time had offered large sums for their readmission into this Kingdome; this could not be done without an odium, and yet the Protector kept what he had in hand as earnest from them.</p>
                     <p>The next design was a Turkish one, having erected the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and power of Major Generals, equal to Bashaws, for the several Counties, but they being upstarrs, and something eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his own entire greatness, he soon after laid them aside, (but never totally abrogated them) having made use of them to levy his new extortion of Decimation.</p>

                     <p>By one of the clauses of the humble Petition and Advice, it was declared, that the Parliament should consist of two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; therefore <hi>Cromwell,</hi> during the adjournment, fill'd up the number of that Other House, that was its name, consisting of sixty two persons, most of them Officers of the Army, and his neer Relations, most of them of mean extraction: These ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, at the expiring of the prorogation appeared, and took their places in the House of Lords, according as the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent custome was, whether the Protector came and sent for the House of Commons, where he made a canting speech to them, but the Commons returning to their House, having admitted all their Members, would neither own the new Lords, nor him that made them so, but fell into high disputes about the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; so that <hi>Cromwell</hi> seeing how the game was likely to go, came, and in a great fury within ten daies after their resit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, dissolved them.</p>

                        <hi>France,</hi> and then General of the English being made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now it pleased God suddenly after this tyranny and cruelty, committed on those innocent persons above-named, to call this Protector to an account, who lingring some time with an ague and a pain in his intestines, on the third day of <hi>September,</hi> his great fortunate day, breathed out h s last, his death being ushered by a most terrible wind, and the coming of a Whale up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> of twenty yards long. Thus ended that wretched Politique.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Oliver</hi> Protector war dead, his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> according to an Article in the Instrument or Government, by which he was to declare his Successor, was by his Fathers Councel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Lord Protector of these three Nations, with the usual solemnities, and accordingly owned by several addresses from most parts of the Kingdome, but drawn and subscribed by some particular persons of the times, who obtruded them upon the rest. He was courted also by the French, Swedish, Dutch Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, who all condoled him for his Fathers death.</p>
                     <p>After a little respit of time, <hi>Richard</hi> was advised to call a Parliament, the Courtiers thinking, that what with the Army and the Lawyers, they should make their party good for the Protector in the House of Commons, being sure of their other House of Peers, and in the mean time took care for his Fathers Funerals; which were solemnized in most ample manner, above the expences usual to any of our Kings deceased, <hi>November</hi> 23. 1658.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament being convened on the 27th of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> the Protector and his new Lords gave them a meeting in the Lords House, where he made a speech to them, which was seconded by the Keeper <hi>Fiennes,</hi> and so departed to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the Lords keeping their seats, and the major part of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, not vouchsafing audience, betook themselves to their own house, and elected <hi>Challoner Chute</hi> for their Speaker.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament being in some measure, fuller then it used, by reason of Knights and Burgesses from <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> began with the old Trade of questioning the power. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, the debate came to this result, that they would recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the Lord Protector, but so that nothing should be binding, till all other Acts to be prepared by the Parliament should likewise pass and be confirmed: For the other House also, that no stop might be put to the great design of setling the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29477:133"/> which was then aimed at, and that question of owning them being but a baulk to their proceeding, they resolved to transact with them for this Parliament as a House of Peers, not excluding the right of other the Peers of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Protector, at the instance of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> had rigg'd forth a Fleet for the <hi>Sound,</hi> which being ready to set sail, the Parliament ordered that for this time the Protector should have the mannagement of the Militia in this expedition, reserving to themselves the Supreme right thereto; that Fleet, after six moneths time, returned back again, <hi>re infecta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the debates flew high in the House of Commons, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the lessening the power of the Sword, which was grown so exorbitant; therefore the Army being sensible whereto such consultations would finally tend, resolved to break up the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and accordingly, having secured the Protector, made him sign a Commission to <hi>Fiennes</hi> to dissolve it, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was done, though the House of Commons, to prevent it, adjourned themselves for three daies; but then out came a Proclamation, forced likewise from the Protector, whereby he declared that Parliament to be absolutely dissolved.</p>
                     <p>Now the Army; and some of the tail of the Parliament which were turned out by <hi>Oliver</hi> in 1653. joyn their heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so make way for their free Commonwealth again. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> Protector is laid aside, the Officers of the Army playing some eight daies with the Government, and then resigning it to those men, who very readily imbraced the motion, and met <hi>May</hi> 7. in the House the Old Speaker; and some forty more making up a <hi>Quorum,</hi> and forthwith published a Declaration, how that by the wonderful Providence and goodness of God they were restored, which to most seemed the saddest judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could befall the Nation.</p>
                     <p>Presently they fall to their old trade of squeezing money; and providing sure for themselves against any more attempts of the Army, leisurely purging out those that had been active with <hi>Oliver</hi> against them, but by all means refuse to admit those Members that by the like force were formerly secluded in 1648. They depose the Protector, and make him sign a Resignation, yet promising him the yearly allowance of 10000 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> and the payment of his debts, so that they thought themselves now cock-slue, levying money by taxes before hand, to gratifie the Army, for the peoples love they never expected, and then settle the Militia in confiding hands.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lambert</hi> hereupon, for we must suppose he is the Agent for his own ambition, though also agreed upon by <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and the rest of the Officers, erect a Committee of Safety of some thirty of the most eminent amongst them, into whose hands they devolve the Supreme Authority.</p>
                     <p>But the Members of the Rump resolve not to be baffled so, Sir <hi>Arthur Hazelrig</hi> in <hi>December</hi> possest himself of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and General <hi>Monk</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> declares his unsatisfiedness in these proceedings of the Army at <hi>London,</hi> so that while <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was ingaged in the North, and attending the issue of a Treaty with General <hi>Monk</hi> there, the Members return from <hi>Portsmouth</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> through the division they had wrought in the Army, the way they chalked out to their own ruine.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> was also risen with a sufficient force, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining <hi>Lamberts</hi> men from free quarter; so that lacking mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and news arrived of the Parliaments sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> he comes back to <hi>London,</hi> whither immediately followed him General <hi>Monk,</hi> having been courted all along his march by the

                     <p>At his coming to the Parliament, he declared the sense of the Countryes through which he passed, but nothing less was minded by them then a new or free Parliament; but this, and other his actions, rendred him very suspitious to them, nor was any man assured of his intentions. To try him therefore, the Rump having been denied moneys by the City, and therefore offended with them; to ruine both, by their express Command, the General was sent with his Army into the City, pulled down their Gates and Portcullises, seized several Citizens at the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> and sent them to the Tower; this seemed to portend some dreadful conclusion: But in the interim, the Rump voted, that the Government of the Army should rest in five persons, making the General one of those; which procedure of theirs, presently drew the Curtain to the Scene and design ensuing.</p>

All the way the way through the City, the General rode bareheaded next before his Majestie, his two Brothers, <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloucester</hi> riding of each side covered. After a short congratulation, the King being weary, went to his Bed-chamber, where he supped, and so to his rest, having come 27 miles that day, besides his going through <hi>London;</hi> and within two days after, his Royal Brethren having taken their places in the House of Lords, came to the Parliament, where he made a Speech, earnestly pressing the Act of Free pardon and indempnity, which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in his Declaration from <hi>Breda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing he did, was the emitting a Proclamation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring all those who had a hand in the execrable murther of his Father, to render themselves within such a time, which some obeyed, the rest fled; those that came in, were (by the Act of Pardon, which came out soon after with some other) respited, till another Parliament should determine of them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to life or death: This was in favour for their rendring themselves.</p>
